"""Write a function that takes as an input a string containing a series of words separated 
by spaces and builds a dictionary where the keys are the last letters of the words 
in the string and the associated values are lists with the words ending with that letter.
 The lists must be ordered lexicographically.
For example, for the string "the only impossible journey is the one you never
 begin" must return {'e':['the', 'impossible', 'the', 'one'], 'y':['only', 'journey'],
 's':['is'], 'u':['you'], 'r':['never'], 'n':['begin']}."""
